# boilerplate-react-bootstrap-webpack
Boilerplate for reactjs with react-boostrap, bundled with webpack.

## Introduction
Super simple boilerplate project with Reactjs used as the V in MVC. In that regard, no assumptions are made concerning what backend technology might be used with this boilerplate. This boilerplate is inspired by [Thomas Coopman's boilerplate](https://github.com/tcoopman/boilerplate-webpack-react), and [Christian Alfoni's react-webpack cookbook](https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/).

Included here:
* webpack as the module bundler
* react-bootstrap

Uses:
* CommonJS notation

## Resources
* For an example of a boilerplate that uses react hot loader, and includes a server side implementation with hapi, see [Thomas Coopman's boilerplate](https://github.com/tcoopman/boilerplate-webpack-react). 
* For a nice description of how-tos for using webpack with reactjs, many have referenced Pete Hunt's [webpack-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto). 
* That said, I found [Christian Alfoni's react-webpack cookbook](https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/) very helpful.
